In the DB you most likely will have
	-Multiple Tables
	-Relationship bw tables

Advance Mapping
	- OneToOne
	- OneToMany
	- ManyToMany
	
--------------------------------OneToOneUni-----------------------------------------------
Each Instructor can have an "instructor detail" entity.

Development Process
	1. Define DB Table (instructor and instructor_detail)
	2. Create InstructorDetail Class
	3. Create Instructor Class
	4. Create Main Class (CreateDemo.java and DeleteDemo.java)
--------------------------------OneToOneBi---------------------------------------------------
New Use Case: If we load Instructor Detail we would like to get the associated Instructor

Development Process
	1. Make Updates to InstructorDetail Class
		@OneToOne(mappedBy=
	2.Create GetInstructorDetailDemo.java

Now , Bi-directional Cascade Delete
Expectation : Delete Instructor Detail also cascade delete Instructor
Development Process:
	Create DeleteInstructorDetailDemo.java

Expectation : Delete Instructor Detail but do not  delete Instructor
Development Process:
	Create DeleteOnlyInstructorDetailDemo.java
Note: We need to break the bi-directional link
